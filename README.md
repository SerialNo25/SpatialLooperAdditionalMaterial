# SpatialLooperAdditionalMaterial
This repository hosts redirect pages for external material referenced in the [Spatial Looper bachelor thesis](https://github.com/SerialNo25/TheSpatialLooper):
Each HTML file provides a persistent link that can be updated independently of the actual video or content location.

## Purpose

In order to future-proof external links (e.g., YouTube videos), this repository uses GitHub Pages to serve redirect pages.  
This allows me to update the destination of a video or resource later without changing the link in the thesis.
